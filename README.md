# Design of an one hidden layer neural network using numpy

Design of an one hidden layer shallow neural network using numpy only, 

X as input Matrix, Y = Output  Vectorized over entire training set

A series of alternate blue and red dot plot in a graph is fed to this neural network. See the picture below.

After 10k epoch it's upto 90% accurately distinguishing between red dots and blue dots.
